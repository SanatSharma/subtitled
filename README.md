# subtitled

Subtitled is a web app that helps provide live subtitles for any meeting or lecture by converting speech to text. The interface can be accessed over any media device through a web browser

The service currently uses the Bing Speech API, to make project work:
  1) Host server.js
  2) In Client/index.html, add your BING_SPEECH_KEY, and change ws variable to point to your server location
  3) Do the same with The Leader index.html, provided in Leader branch.
